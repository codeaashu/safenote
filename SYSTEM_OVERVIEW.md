# SafeNote - Username-Based Password Protected System

## üéâ New Features Implemented

### System Overview
SafeNote now uses a **username-based, password-protected system** that requires no traditional authentication signup. Users can create their own private workspaces using just a username and password.

### How It Works

#### 1. **Username-Based URLs**
- Users access workspaces via: `safenote.vercel.app/username`
- Example: `safenote.vercel.app/john`, `safenote.vercel.app/alice`

#### 2. **Create New Workspace**
When a user visits a non-existent username:
- Shows "Create New Site?" dialog
- User confirms to create workspace
- Sets up username + password protection
- No email required!

#### 3. **Password Protection**
- Each workspace is protected by a user-defined password
- Only people with the correct password can access the workspace
- Perfect for sharing: give someone your username + password

#### 4. **Private Pastes**
- All pastes are private to each username workspace
- Users see only their own created pastes
- Pastes can still be shared via direct links if password is known

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

### New Tables Added

#### `users` table:
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- username (VARCHAR, Unique)
- password (VARCHAR) 
- created_at (Timestamp)
```

#### Updated `pastes` table:
```sql
- Added: username (VARCHAR) - links paste to user workspace
```

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add username column to pastes
ALTER TABLE pastes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS username VARCHAR(50);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pastes_username ON pastes(username);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_username ON users(username);

-- Enable RLS and policies
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE pastes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to users" ON users FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to pastes" ON pastes FOR ALL USING (true);
```
